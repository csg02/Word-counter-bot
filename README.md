# Word counter bot
A discord slash bot made in python which counts every word said in a discord server and stores them in a .json file.

## Requirements:
```
discord.py
discord-py-slash-command
```

## Get started
Just fill in the config.json Token field with your bot token.




## Improvements

Feel free to PR improvements as I am way too lazy to extend this much further than it's original purpose.
