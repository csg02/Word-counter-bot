# Word counter bot
A discord slash bot made in python which counts every word said in a discord server and stores them in a .json file.

```
discord.py
discord-py-slash-command

```

## Get started

### Improvements
```
Feel free to PR improvements as I am way too lazy to extend this much further than it's original purpose.
