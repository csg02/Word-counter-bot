## What data does the bot store?
Word Counter stores all words said in a server and uses the server ID to identify what words were said where.

## Why is this data needed?
The data is needed so that it can tell you how many times a certain word has been said.

## Who can access this data?
No one apart from the bot owner but I have no need to look through it anyway.

## Request deletion of your data or concerns you may have:
You may send a message to SoulRika#2928 on Discord to request deletion of your servers data or raise any concerns you may have.
